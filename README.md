# LocationBasedWeatherAPI

This weather application displays the weather for any given city after entered into the search bar. 
The display shows the current weather within the city as well as a five day forecast.

## Description

I created this application using an open weather API for both the city and the five day forecast, using the current date to provide the five day forecast. 
The application provides temp, humidity, wind speed, as well as a weather description ("overcast") and a small icon img representing that description.
